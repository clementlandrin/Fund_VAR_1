Fund VAR - TRACKING

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Program structure :

- Initialization

- Main Loop

Initialization :

- Creation of window

- Callbacks (keys and mouse) set up

Main Loop :

- Blop detections

- Find position and orientation of the glasses using POSIT method in the camera space

- Transform the position and orientation matrix so we can track the eyes in the world space

- Send the positions of the three eyes (left, cyclope and right) using a client OSC

Blop detections :

- Find contours using image masks, HSV space and tolerance

- Create and smooth a bouding rectangle using the contour

- Set the center of the rectangle as the center of the corresponding color blop

- Return the center of the blop
