The scene is composed of height targets and a black rectangle background composed of green hexagones.

The camera as three attached script : Osc, UDP Packet IO and OSC receive camera adaptive.
The main script is OSC receive camera adaptive, while the two others are used to communitcate and receive the camera position input.

The public parameters of OSCReceiveCameraAdaptive are :
	- RemoteIP (here default value to "127.0.0.1")
	- SendToPort (here default value to 0)
	- ListenerPort (here default value to 0)
	- object_to_look (a Unity class defining where the camera is looking at)

RemoteIP should be set to 127.0.0.1 as it is the IP address of localhost.
ListenerPort should be set to 7000 as it is the port used by OSC to connect in the python script.
object_to_look should be set to screen.

The Z coordinate is reversed as we are behind the screen.
